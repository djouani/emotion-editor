<p>
Emotion editor contains three agents. You perform actions with the agents by selecting a target agent and the utility to give to the target, and clicking on the "Do" link.
Positive utilities represent kind or useful acts, and negative utilities unkind or harmful acts. 
Agents respond to actions with emotions, that are determined according to a set of fixed rules that take into account the current event, the history of events and the agent's relations to other agents.
<br />
<br />
An arrow from one agent towards another shows the attitude (like/love or dislike/hate) of the first agent towards the other. It also shows the future expectations (desire/hope or disgust/fear). In this simulation attitude and future expectations always correspond with each other, i.e. an agent cannot for example love something that it fears. 
The utility is the average utility of the actions that the second agent has done for the first agent. If it is positive, the target is liked, and vice versa. 
<br />
<br />
Expected rewards is the sum of average utilities of all known agents.
Value of self is the average utility of own actions. 
Agents' bodies are yellow when they are in a good or neutral mood and blue when they are in a bad mood.

Emotion Editor does not work without JavaScript.
